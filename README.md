# Hi there, I'm Rebecca ğŸ‘‹

### Architect by university, Frontend Developer in training. Based in South Africa ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦


I completed my studies in Architecture and Urbanism at Feevale University in Brazil, including one semester abroad at Politecnico di Milano in Italy. I have been working in the Architecture field for over 7 years.
I have also been on a journey learning new skills and discovered a great interest in Frontend Development and UI Design. So far, I have pursued my learning through various platforms, including Free Code Camp, Scrimba and Udemy and I intend to keep on learning.
Good design makes me happy and I believe it has the ability to improve people's experiences.
My work and personal experiences, especially moving countries and becoming a mother, have enhanced my adaptability, resilience, and perseverance to push through challenging situations.

Some facts about me:
- I was born in the South of Brazil and grew up there ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·
- I lived in Italy for a while ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ 
- I now live in South Africa with my family ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦
- I am fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, English and I also speak Italian.
