# Hi there, I'm Rebecca 👋

### Frontend Developer. Based in South Africa 🇿🇦

I am a Junior Frontend Developer making a career transition after working as an Architect for about 7 years. 
<br>
My background in architecture gives me an advantage as a developer in the following ways: an eye for aesthetically pleasing and functional design, high attention to detail, and problem-solving skills, finding creative solutions to design challenges. 
<br>
My work and personal experiences have enhanced my adaptability, resilience, and perseverance to push through challenging situations. 
<br>
I have pursued my frontend development learning through various platforms, including freeCodeCamp and Udemy. I also recently completed The Frontend Developer Career Path through Scrimba, and I intend to keep on learning.

Some facts about me:
- I was born and grew up in the south of Brazil 🇧🇷
- I lived in Italy for a while 🇮🇹 
- I now live in South Africa with my family 🇿🇦
- I am fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, English and I also speak Italian.
